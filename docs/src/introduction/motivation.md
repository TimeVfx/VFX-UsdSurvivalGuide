# Motivation [序言]
As [USD](https://openusd.org/release/index.html) has been consistently increasing its market share in the recent years, it is definitely a technology to be aware of when working in any industry that uses 3d related data. It is becoming the de facto standard format on how different applications and vendors exchange their data.

[ 由于近年来 USD 的市场份额不断增加，因此在任何与 3D 数据相关的行业中，这绝对是一项需要了解的技术。并且它正在成为不同应用程序和合作商之间交换数据的标准格式。]

You might be thinking:

[ 您可能会想 ]
```admonish question title=""
Oh no another guide! Do we really need this?

[ 我们真的需要这个吗? ]
```

This guide aims to solve the following 'niche':

[ 本指南旨在解决以下“基本”问题：]
- It aims to be an onboarding guide for software developers & pipeline developers so that you can hit the ground running.

    [ 成为软件开发人员和流程开发人员的入门指南，以便您可以快速上手]
- It aims to be practical as opposed to offering a high-level overview. This means you'll find a lot of code examples from actual production scenarios as well as a more hands on approach instead of overviews/terminology explanations. We'll often link to resources you can look into before a certain section to have a better understanding should vocabulary issues arise.

    [ 以实用性为目标，而不是高层次的概述. 就是说您将找到大量来自实际生产场景的代码示例和实践方法，而不是概述和术语的解释. 通常我们会在章节之前连接一些你需要查看的资源, 以帮助您更好的理解文章中的术语]
- It aims to soften the steep learning curve that some aspects of USD have by having a look at common production examples so you can have those sweet "aha, that's how it works" moments.

    [ 通过学习生产中常见的例子来降低学习 USD 的难度, 使你能轻松的应对" ]

Basically think of it as a balance of links listed in the below resources section.

[ 基本上就是下面资源的通俗易懂版本]
```admonish tip
If this is your first time working with Usd, we recommend watching this 20 minute video from Apple:

[ 如果这是您第一次使用USD，我们建议您观看Apple的这段20分钟视频：]

[Understand USD fundamentals (Frm WWDC 2022)](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10129/)

[ 它以非常简洁的方式涵盖了基本术语 ]
```

```admonish info title="A big thank you to the VFX community!"
At this point of the guide, we just want to state, that we didn't re-invent the wheel here: A big thank you to all the (open-source) projects/tutorials/guides that cover different aspects of Usd. You have been a big help in designing this guide as well as giving great insights. There is no one-to-rule them all documentation, so please consider contributing back to these projects if possible!

[ 针对此指南，我们想明确指出，我们并没有重新发明轮子：感谢所有涵盖 USD 不同方面的（开源）项目、教程和指南. 你们在设计和完善本指南的过程中提供了巨大的帮助，并为我们提供了深刻的见解. 目前并没有一份能够涵盖所有内容的权威文档，因此，如果可能的话，请考虑回馈这些项目，为它们做出贡献！]
