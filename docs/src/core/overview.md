# USD Essentials [USD基础知识]
In our essentials section, we cover the basics of USD from a software developer perspective.

[ 在基础知识部分，我们从软件开发人员的角度介绍 USD 的基础知识]

That means we go over the most common base classes we'll interacting with in our day-to-day work.

[ 这意味着我们将回到在日常工作中与之打交道最多的基类开始]

Our approach is to start by looking at the smallest elements in USD and increasing complexity until we talk about how different broader aspects/concepts of USD work together.

[ 我们的方法是从USD的最小单元开始研究，并逐渐增加其复杂性，直到我们讨论USD的多维度协同工作]

That does mean we do **not** provide a high level overview. As mentioned in our [motivation](../introduction/motivation.md) section, this guide is conceptualized to be an onboarding guide for developers. We therefore take a very code heavy and deep dive approach from the get-go.

[ 这表明我们的确不提供高层次的概述。正如我们在[序言](../introduction/motivation.md)中所提到的，本指南旨在成为开发人员的入门指南。因此，我们从一开始就采取了深入研究大量代码的方法]

Don't be scared though! We try to stay as "generic" as possible, avoiding USD's own terminology where possible.

[ 不过不用担心！我们尽可能保持“通俗易懂”的方式，尽可能避免使用 USD 的术语]

Are you ready to dive into the wonderful world of USD? Then let's get started!
